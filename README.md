.vimrc

Assembled from many sources, but significantly [Max
Goldstein](https://github.com/mgold/.vim) and [Marshall
Moutenot](https://github.com/mmoutenot/Vimrc).

Do remember to source supertab--open up `supertab.vmb` in vim and type

`:source %`

Don't use the arrow keys, you might get unexpected results.
